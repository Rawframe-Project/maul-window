# Design records

Each record explains one decision: the problem, the choice and what it
costs.

Family records apply to every Maul library and are identical in every
repository; they are numbered `NNNN` and listed below. A library's own
records carry its prefix (`P-NNNN`) and are listed in `docs/adr/P.md`
(record 0015).

Records are numbered in order and never renumbered. A decision that is
reversed gets a new record that supersedes the old one; the old one
stays, marked superseded.

## Template

```md
# NNNN. Title in sentence case

Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by NNNN

## Context

What problem forced a decision, with the facts that matter.

## Decision

What we do, stated so that code review can check it.

## Consequences

What this costs, what it enables, and what we give up.
