  quit), windows as ids with requests answered by exactly one
  completion (`mwinCreateWindow`, `mwinDestroyWindow`,
  `mwinGetWindowState`, `mwinRequestTitle`, `mwinRequestSize`,
  `mwinRequestPosition`, `mwinRequestMode`, `mwinRequestVisible`,
  `mwinRequestFocus`), and the ordered event stream (`mwinNextEvent`),
  with the named limits (mwin-0002).

  the contract tests against it.
- Maul Unicode 0.2.0 as a dependency, found installed or fetched
