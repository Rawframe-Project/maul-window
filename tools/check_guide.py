# The guide's C snippets are built and run by the tests: every ```c block
# of docs/guide.md must appear unchanged in one of test/test_guide*.c,
# every non-blank line indented by the same number of spaces (blank lines
# stay blank), so a snippet that no longer builds or runs fails the tests
# instead of drifting from the API. A block whose fence line comes right
# after the comment
#
#     <!-- guide: not run: REASON -->
#
# is not checked, for a fragment no test can build everywhere (another
# platform's API, say); the reason is printed. A guide without C blocks
# passes; a library without docs/guide.md has nothing to check.
#
# usage: check_guide.py
